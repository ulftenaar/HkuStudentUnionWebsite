You can take part in protests or other actions and help us by spreading the word about the union. </p> <p> In organising, you can help the union by joining already existing workgroups or use our network to set up a new group with a new goal. You can join meetings, write articles, organise events, design, there is a place for everyone, no matter how much you can give. </p><p> <em>Not being active for a while is completely fine, and also healthy. </em></p> </section>  </div>
