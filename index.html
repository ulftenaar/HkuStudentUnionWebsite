            <div class="t subsubtitle">Mission Statement</div>
            <em>Do Something about institutional racism <br> Do Something about complicity in genocide <br> Do Something about democratising HKU<br> Do Something about student wellbeing<br> Do Something about creating an HKU-wide community<br></em>
            <p><strong>Do Something | HKU Student Union</strong> <br> Mission Statement: </p>          <p>Every policy decision about the HKU is made by the unelected board of directors. This makes the HKU a very undemocratic institution. The only prominent form of student representation is that of class representatives, whose advice to the board is non-binding, and whose role is in facilitating isolated communication between individual students and faculty directors. </p>  <p>The HKU student union opposes the undemocratic nature of the HKU and aims to facilitate the coming together of critical students across all HKU schools. It is a loose association meant to provide the connecting tissue between otherwise isolated students, so we can speak up and influence the policies that affect our community as a unified voice. By providing channels of communication, we can facilitate meetings to organise protests, mass complains or negotiations with the board. Furthermore, we aim to publish zines, statements, posters, etc. communicating our goals and ideas.</p>        </section>

            <div class="t subsubtitle">Structure of the Union</div>
            <p>The HKU Student Union is organised as a flat structure. No one has any power over anyone else, and decisions are made by consensus. Anyone is welcome to participate in organising the union and related workgroups or write articles for the zine and other platforms we may establish. If you’d like to do anything on behalf of the union, please do present your ideas at a meeting, send us an email or message us in the signal chat. If this way of organising becomes unsustainable or impractical, we may review it and establish a more formal way of organising the union.</p> 

            <strong>What does it mean to be a member?</strong> <br>
            As a member of the union you can either take on an organisational role or a following role 
            In following, your voice can empower us in a protest or a petition, and you become a valuable part of our network. This will take little time and energy. All you need to do is join the whatsapp community, follow our newsletter and/or sign up for the union (for which you can find the link on the back of this zine). Input about things happening at your school or helping us build our network through your contacts is helpful.
            <p>In organising, you can organise – pretty straight forward. You can either join already existing workgroups or use our network to set up a new group with a new goal. We strive to realise both smaller and bigger goals. You can do this by signing up and joining a work group / organisation chat (signal).</p>

            you are not obliged to do anything when you sign up - it’s more of a network through which we can reach you. for now also one of the big focusses is on the workshops. but also a network for future power to the students (to make all the work we put into uniting into a sustainable way to raise our voice and to continue beyond this one thing)

          <section id="AlumniPolicy">
            <div class="t subsubtitle">Statement about the abolished alumni workshop policy </div>
            <p>As of the 1st of  September 2025, it will no longer be possible for alumni to use the workshops at the HKU. In the past, the rule was that this was allowed in the academic year immediately after your graduation. All students who are currently doing a bachelor's, master's or associate's degree will no longer be able to use this arrangement. </p> <p>The cancellation of this arrangement was communicated to HKU students on the 1st of April via a short message on the Studentportal. This message states that the CvB (Executive Board) has taken this decision because (part of) the money that keeps the workshop running comes from the government. According to a government policy rule, this money may not be used for 'external parties' (in this case, graduates). However, the policy rule has been in effect since 2022; it is unclear why this would only influence the CvB's decision on the alumni arrangement now. It is also unclear why this policy rule would only affect the HKU; other universities of applied sciences (such as the KABK) still maintain a similar alumni arrangement. The CvB of the KABK seems to not have chosen to stop the rule for the use of workshops for their graduates. </p> <p> The student union does not agree with the cancellation of this arrangement. It is of great importance for the future of HKU graduates that this does not happen. Moreover, students chose their education with the idea that they could continue to use the workshops for a while after graduating. This was not communicated to all students in a timely or effective manner. The list of alternative workshops in the message on the Studentportal cannot be compared to the facilities that are currently available at the HKU. It is of great importance that these facilities remain available for alumni. It is especially crucial for (international) students who have a (financial or other) disadvantage. </p> <p> As a student union, we are open to your ideas. Do you have something you want to change, something big, or something small? Let us know! </p> <p>  One of the things we are currently working on is the removal of the alumni working at the workshops, but your proposal may encompass any aspect of your time at the HKU.</p>
