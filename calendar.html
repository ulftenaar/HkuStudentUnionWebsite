                    <p>
                      Coming Monday the 26th of May, HKU4Palestine will organise
                      a sit-in in the Atrium of Oudenoord. We do this to urge
                      the CVB (College Van Bestuur) to finally meet our demands,
                      listed below. Despite our numerous attempts to convince
                      the CVB of the importance of these demands, after more
                      than a year, the CVB has been incapable of meeting these
                      demands and breaking ties with Israel. Therefore, we will
                      inform the CVB that our demands have not changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Please join our sit-in, attend our workshops and join
                      forces. HKU students and staff, let’s finally mobilize!
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Our demands: </strong><br>
                    
                      The HKU must write a statement that clearly rejects the
                      genocide, disproportionate violence, and impending ethnic
                      cleansing committed by Israel <br />
                      The HKU must sever ties with Bezalel Academy of Arts and
                      Design <br />
                      The HKU must investigate any connections with Israeli
                      institutions, companies and investors, making these
                      public, and severing these ties
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong> Program: </strong> <br>  Start @ 12:00 atrium Oudenoord Activitities </br>

                      for the protesting or for your own patches etc. think

                      instruments so we can make some noise! (or nice music
                      occasionally). </p> <p>  The sit in will be inspired by the
                      character of the UU encampment - so we can connect, learn
                      and make a statement! If you can also bring food for the
                      HKU Student Union’s potluck in the evening! </p> <p>
                      <strong>Potluck</strong> <br>
                      Even Ants need to rest after an action. So the Union is
                      organising a Potluck at Paardenveld on May 26st, right after the demonstration at Nieuwekade. Bring yourself, your
                      friends, your enthousiasm and if you can a vegan
                      meal/snack. Lets take some time to unwind after a full day and meet some of
                      your fellow friends from the ant hill.

            On the HKU there are a LOT of different student initiatives, and as
            chaotic art students it is hard to keep track of all of them. This
            calendar is meant for activities of the Union but also of other
            events organised by (or for) HKU students or teachers.
