            The Union tries to be as open as possible. On this page you can find
            most information about our organisation and our values. This page is
            a work in progress and we are updating it constantly. <br />

            <p>
              Every policy decision about the HKU is made by the unelected board
              of directors, the CvB. This makes the HKU a very undemocratic
              institution. The only prominent form of student representation is
              that of class representatives, whose advice to the board is
              non-binding, and whose role is in facilitating isolated
              communication between individual students and faculty directors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The CvB has rolled in favour of negative policies for the students
              and staff of the HKU such as: <br />
              - The ban on Alumni students from HKU Workshops, leaving students
              without the tools to easily continue their practices.<br />
              - The pretending ignorance of institutional racism that made two
              teachers quit their position.<br />
              - The change from a self-owned mailing service and move towards
              Microsoft Outlook, furthering depending HKU on private American
              technology companies.<br />
              - The dissolution of the technical center at HKU Oudenoord, a
              space created to help students, to create an office for a higher
              up.
            </p>

            <p>
              The HKU student union opposes the undemocratic nature of the HKU
              and aims to facilitate the coming together of critical students
              across all HKU schools. It is a loose association meant to provide
              the connecting tissue between otherwise isolated students, so we
              can speak up and influence the policies that affect our community
              as a unified voice. By providing channels of communication, we can
              facilitate meetings to organise protests, mass complains or
              negotiations with the board. Furthermore, we aim to publish zines,
              statements, posters, etc. communicating our goals and ideas.

          <section id="about2">
            <div class="t subsubtitle">Why do we need a Union?</div>
            <p>
              The HKU is the final step before students go into the job market
              to sell their labour. The education and conditions of the HKU is
              what will dictate student performance and learnt skills. Therefore
              it has an immense impact in the future life of all students.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the present, each and every student, teacher and employee, has
              a full life in the HKU, whether its classes, social activities or
              others, the way the school is ran has a direct impact on their day
              to day life, of which poor management can cause severe negative
              consequences to the students such as mental problems and financial
              stress. For most students, and some teachers, the HKU is a place
              they go to almost every day, so it is of importance that everyone
              can feel at home and that their needs are met.
            </p>
            <p>
              After studying, the HKU continues to have impact, since there are
              800 <sup>1</sup> new young artists leaving into the world every
              year. The values and way of thinking that the alumni have been
              exposed to, continues to live on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next to the individual lives, the HKU as an institution has a
              massive impact. Being one of the biggest art schools in Europe,
              with a cash flow of 70 million per year, more than 4400 students,
              and 900 employees<sup>1</sup>, the HKU is not a small, cozy
              school, that it impersonates. Considering that the HKU has so much
              impact, it is of utmost importance, to have a fully independent
              organisation - that represents the values of the students and
              teachers - to keep the CvB of the HKU in check.
            </p>
            <p>
              As opposed to the other limbs of the HKU with students and
              teachers involved, like the CMR and the OC. The Union can take
              more direct actions, like negotiation, demonstrations and
              protests. In these actions, the students and teachers take a much
              more active role.

            <div class="t subsubtitle">Who are the members?</div>
            <p>
              Although we are called the HKU Student Union, teachers, employees
              and alumni are also welcome to join. The Union is for everyone who
              wants their voice heard.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organising members are also all students, who make time for
              the Union, some join the meetings weekly, and some sporadically.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="about4">
            <div class="t subsubtitle">Structure of the Union</div>
            <p>
              In the Union, everyone is equal. We are a flat organisation
              without an executive board or leaders. We make decisions by
              consensus. We have general meetings every Thursday, where everyone
              can join, and share their vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              To participate in the Union you can either take on an
              organisational role or a following role. In following, your voice
              can empower us in a protest or a petition, and you become a
              valuable part of our network. Apart from that, you can also help
              us by spreading the word about the Union and our activities. Input
              about things happening at your school or helping us build our
              network through your contacts is helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              In organising, you can organise – pretty straight forward. You can
              either join already existing work groups or use our network to set
              up a new group with a new goal. We strive to realise both smaller
              and bigger goals. You can do this by signing up and joining a work
              group / organisation chat (signal).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’d like to do anything on behalf of the union, please do
              present your ideas at a meeting, send us an email or message us in
              the signal chat. If this way of organising becomes unsustainable
              or impractical, we may review it and establish a more formal way
              of organising the union.

          <section id="about5">
            <div class="t subsubtitle">Communication</div>
            <p>
              The union uses multiple platforms to communicate to our members.
              The most import being this website and our newsletter. The
              newsletter will be sent via email 1-2 times every month, where we
              will send updates regarding our activities, upcoming activities
              and more information. Apart from these, we also send updates
              regularly in our Whatsapp community, where members can also
              discuss among themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              For organisational communication, the Union uses Signal
              exclusively. This is our platform of choice for private
              conversations. <br />
              The union uses Cryptpad as our online data storage, as well as
              writing other docs and our meeting notes. <br />
              The Union uses Fastmail as our mailing service and internal
              calendar. The Union’s website is run using a Github repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Union is heavily against Meta, Google, and other Big Tech
              companies. It strives to use as many open source platforms as
              possible, which business models are not exploiting their users.
              Which is the reason why the Union avoids using Instagram to inform
              it's members.
            </p>
            <p>
              To also reach students/teachers/employees, that are not members
              yet, the Union also make use of posters/stickers, and will
              occasionally spread messages via Whatsapp groups.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="about6">
            <div class="t subsubtitle">How do we accomplish our goals?</div>
            <p>
              The Union strongly believes that united the members can accomplish
              a whole lot, we call ourselves the ants for a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first step to accomplish anything is always to inform, so that
              members can make their own opinions. We do that mainly with
              posters and articles. We use other platforms to spread those
              physically and online.
            </p>
            <p>
              We then try to create a movement, to make sure the people that the
              message is for, hear us loudly and clearly. We make petitions,
              make art, or do patching sessions. In the meantime, the Union will
              usually contact the representatives of the opposing side. And
              invite them to negotiate. The Union tries to de-escalate wherever
              possible, but also stands firm and protects our mission.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the Union sees no other way but to escalate, we can organise
              demonstrations or strikes. These go by strict rules, and will
              always be non-violent. We look back with pride to what our
              comrades already accomplished with peaceful movements, and follow
              their example.
            </p>

          <section id="about10">
            <div class="t subsubtitle">Action Concencus</div>
            <p>
              Please (re)read this action consensus carefully, it is the Union's
              binding framework for every action. Because of it, we can ensure
              that our actions are transparent and that the expectations are
              clear for the people involved, but also for people on the outside.
              The Union is not responsible for the individuals who do not follow
              our action consensus, putting themselves, their fellow
              participants, but also the power of the whole movement at risk.
              <br />
              Anyone who agrees to follow this consensus is welcome to join any
              one of our actions.

                We treat everyone equally and with respect. We do not
                discriminate based on race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, income
                or any other basis. Other forms of hate, like antisemitism,
                homophobia, islamofobie, etc. are also not acceptable
              </li>
              <li>
                We always remain non-violent. We do not actively resist against
                the police, and we try to de-escalate the situation when
                possible.
              </li>

                We are not under influence of drugs nor do we have any with us

            <p>
              Transparency is important, especially with an organisation that
              works with, and for the Members of the Union. Members have the
              right to stay informed with our decisions and the reasons behind
              them. Therefore we strive to publish our meeting notes, and share
              as much information as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone is welcome at our meetings, as they are usually in the

            <p>
              The Union currently does not receive any funding from the HKU,
              government or any other instance. Although all of our members do
              any work voluntarily, we still rely on donations for our, tiny,
              but existing expenses. We pay 5 euro’s per month for our email
              service and 6 euro’s per year for our website domain. Apart from
              our fixed expenses, other expenses include, but are not limited
              to: material costs, printing costs, food and snacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              We track all of our finances using Actual Budget, and we will
              publish our financial reports on our website.

              We are aware that speaking for 4400 students and 900 employees
              <sup>1</sup>, is quite the responsibility. Any decision made by
              the Union is made carefully by multiple members. Every article and
              written document is shared to the organising members, so it is
              checked before being published. Never do we force any member or
              student/teacher to stand behind us, every individual makes their
              own decision on each matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              After every action, we asses and debrief. We talk about what
              happened, and what we will do different next time. We also ask for
              feedback from members as much as possible, and are always open for
              conversation.
