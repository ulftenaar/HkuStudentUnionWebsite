Every policy decision about the HKU is made by the unelected board of directors. This makes the HKU a very undemocratic institution. The only prominent form of student representation is that of class representatives, whose advice to the board is non-binding, and whose role is in facilitating isolated communication between individual students and faculty directors.

The HKU student union opposes the undemocratic nature of the HKU and aims to facilitate the coming together of critical students across all HKU schools. It is a loose association meant to provide the connecting tissue between otherwise isolated students, so we can speak up and influence the policies that affect our community as a unified voice. By providing channels of communication, we can facilitate meetings to organise protests, mass complains or negotiations with the board. Furthermore, we aim to publish zines, statements, posters, etc. communicating our goals and ideas.
